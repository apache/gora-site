### 01 July, 2014: Apache Gora joins the [DARPA Open Catalog](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/)

<img src="http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/Open-Catalog-Single-Big.png" alt="Open Catalog Logo">

Gora now features within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Open Catalog 
as part of ongoing participation in the [XDATA Program](http://www.darpa.mil/opencatalog/XDATA.html).

XDATA is developing an open source software library for big data to help overcome the 
challenges of effectively scaling to modern data volume and characteristics. The 
program is developing the tools and techniques to process and analyze large sets of 
imperfect, incomplete data. Its programs and publications focus on the areas of 
analytics, visualization, and infrastructure to efficiently fuse, analyze and 
disseminate these large volumes of data.

Gora is being used by the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](http://jpl.nasa.gov) team to execute
[extract-transform-load](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)-type tasks
for mapping and integration of source heterogeneous data to and from target NoSQL solutions.

### 04 June, 2014: Apache Gora now supports [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

<img src="http://engineering.linkedin.com/sites/default/files/mongodb-logo.png" alt="MongoDB Logo">

The Gora community is proud to announce support MongoDB amongst our growing datastore 
support arsenal. MongoDB is an open-source document database, and the leading NoSQL database. Written in C++, MongoDB features:

* Document-Oriented Storage

* JSON-style documents with dynamic schemas offer simplicity and power.
    
* Full Index Support

* Index on any attribute, just like you're used to.

* Replication & High Availability

* Mirror across LANs and WANs for scale and peace of mind.

* Auto-Sharding

* Scale horizontally without compromising functionality.
    
* Querying

* Rich, document-based queries.

* Fast In-Place Updates

* Atomic modifiers for contention-free performance.

* [MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/mapred_tutorial.html).

* Flexible aggregation and data processing.

* GridFS

* Store files of any size without complicating your stack.

The current supported version of is MongoDB is 2.6 with client version support at 2.12.2. 

### 29 May, 2014: Apache Gora now implemented as [Apache Camel](http://camel.apache.org) Component

<img src="http://camel.apache.org/images/apache-camel-100h.png" alt="Apache Camel Logo">

We recently heard some excellent news that Gora is now implemented as a 
[Camel Component](https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/camel-git/components/camel-gora) within Camel trunk.

Apache Camel is a rule-based routing and mediation engine which provides a Java object based implementation of 
the Enterprise Integration Patterns using an API (or declarative Java Domain Specific Language) to configure 
routing and mediation rules. The domain specific language means that Apache Camel can support type-safe 
smart completion of routing rules in your IDE using regular Java code without huge amounts of XML configuration 
files; though XML configuration inside Spring is also supported.

You can use this module with the following Maven configuration

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
      <artifactId>camel-gora</artifactId>
      <version>x.x.x</version>
      <!-- use the same version as your Camel core version -->
    </dependency>

You can find more information on the history of the development on the relevant [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-4817).

You can also view the [gora-camel](./current/gora-camel.html) documentation.

### 19 May, 2014: Apache Gora at [HBase London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HBase-London/events/179791252/)

<img src="http://hbase.apache.org/images/hbase_logo.png" alt="HBase London Meetup">

Keeping in trend with our continual drive to build the Gora community, Gora is featuring
in this months [HBase London Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/HBase-London/events/179791252/).

The meetup is focused on [data types in HBASE](https://blogs.apache.org/hbase/entry/data_types_schema) c.f. [HBASE-8693](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8693)
[HBASE-8089](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-8089) with the second half of the meetup 
being dedicated to discussion and presentation on where Gora/gora-hbase fits in the mix!

### 14th April, 2014: Gora adopted by [Apache Giraph](http://giraph.apache.org)

<img src="http://giraph.apache.org/images/ApacheGiraph.svg" alt="Apache Giraph" height="200" width="200">

After a successful [Google Summer of Code 2013](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013)
project, Gora has been adopted as a core persistence abstraction for the popular graph processing 
library in use at companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and many more.

The integration of these two awesome Apache projects has as main motivation the 
possibility of turning Gora-supported-NoSQL data stores into Giraph-processable graphs, 
and to provide Giraph the ability to store its results into different data stores, 
letting users focus on the processing itself. For more information please see the 
[Giraph-Gora documentation](https://giraph.apache.org/gora.html).

### 7th - 10th April, 2014: Apache Gora at [ApacheCon NA 2014](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-north-america)

A number of the Gora team were at ApacheCon this year spreading the word about the project and 
presenting on several topics. This included Renato's presentation on 
[Turning NoSQL data into Graphs - Playing with Apache Giraph and Apache Gora](http://sched.co/1bsMgqm)
and Lewis' presentation on [ Deploying Apache Gora as a Query Broker](http://sched.co/1bsM9es).

### 24 January, 2012: Apache Gora Graduates to Top Level Project at the Apache Software Foundation

<p>The biggest event within Apache Gora's history was revealed on 24/01/2012 when it was announced that Apache Gora 
was to be established as a Top Level Project entity within the Apache Software Foundation. This is excellent news for 
the Gora community and we are looking forward to tackling the benefits and challenges brought by our new Top Level status.

### 15 January, 2012: Apache Gora announces full support for <a href="ext:hector"><b>Hector Client</b>:</a>

<p>Some time ago, the Apache Gora development team made the decision to support Hector as the 
primary Apache Cassandra client. This decision enables Gora to build on the expressiveness offered by the 
Hector API, some features include:
<li>high level, simple object oriented interface to Cassandra. </li>
<li>failover behavior on the client side.</li>
<li>connection pooling for improved performance and scalability.</li>
<li>JMX counters for monitoring and management.</li>
<li>configurable and extensible load balancing (round robin (the default), least active, and a phi-accrural style response time detector).</li>
<li>complete encapsulation of the underlying Thrift API and structs.</li>
<li>automatic retry of downed hosts.</li>
<li>automatic discovery of additional hosts in the cluster.</li>
<li>suspension of hosts for a short period of time after several timeouts.</li>
<li>simple ORM layer that works.</li>
<li>a type-safe approach to dealing with Apache Cassandra's data model.</li>
As an Apache community we value community over code, this move is definitely a step in the right direction towards
bringing together two diverse communities, whilst during process undoubtedly making both Apache Gora and Hector better 
technologies. Here at Gora we look forward to working with the Hector community.
