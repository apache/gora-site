Title: How to Contribute

## Gora Development Process
Gora assumes a development process encouraged by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). 
ASF is based on [meritocracy](http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html). 
We encourage open discussion and open development. Nearly everything in Gora is done over 
on the [mailing lists](./mailing_lists.html) and [Jira issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GORA).

Simply put, gora needs you help to move forward. Like all open source projects, you can help gora in several ways:

* **Bug reporting**: No software is bug-free. So please report any issues that arise while using 
  Gora by commenting on an existing bug, or opening a new bug report. You can search, 
  and create new bug reports [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GORA).
* **Feature Request**: Gora should be driven further by feature requests from the community. 
  Reporting ideas for improvement on existing features and new features can help the 
  developers to re-arrange priorities for the project. Use the 
  [issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GORA) for reporting feature 
  requests, or mention your idea at the dev@ mailing list.
* **Developing Patches**: We of course welcome patches from the community. 
  If you find an issue you want to fix, create the issue, develop the patch 
  and attach the patch to the issue. You can see some of the **newbie** issues 
  [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%2012311172%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie)
* **Sharing Use Cases**: You can share how you use gora in your projects. We
  also encourage users to add thier use cases to our [PoweredBy](./poweredby.html) page.
* **Contributing Documentation**: You can also contribute to the ongoing documentation 
  effort of the project by editing [wiki pages](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GORA/Index), 
  improving javadocs or writing blog posts. You can also answer user questions at the [mailing lists](./mailing_lists.html).
* **Spreading the word**: We encourage you to share your feedback on gora with us and 
  with others, by tweeting, blogging, etc.
* **Participating in GSoC**: As a community and project, Gora has a successful record
  in participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).
  As a community we greatly encourage students to engage in such efforts.
