   availability and durability.
* [Apache Accumulo](https://accumulo.apache.org) - The Apache Accumulo™ sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, 
   scalable, high performance data storage and retrieval system. Apache Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and 
   is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift. Apache Accumulo features a few novel improvements on the
