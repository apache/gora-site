   All data items are stored on Solid State Drives (SSDs), and are replicated across 3 Availability Zones for high 
   availability and durability.
* [Apache Accumulo](http://accumulo.apache.org) - The Apache Accumulo™ sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, 
   scalable, high performance data storage and retrieval system. Apache Accumulo is based on Google's BigTable design and 
   is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift. Apache Accumulo features a few novel improvements on the 
   BigTable design in the form of cell-based access control and a server-side programming mechanism that can modify 
   key/value pairs at various points in the data management process.
* [Apache Avro](http://avro.apache.org) - Apache Avro™ is a data serialization system.
* [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) - The Apache Cassandra database is the right choice when you need 
   scalability and high availability without compromising performance. Linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance on 
   commodity hardware or cloud infrastructure make it the perfect platform for mission-critical data. Cassandra's 
   support for replicating across multiple datacenters is best-in-class, providing lower latency for your users and 
   the peace of mind of knowing that you can survive regional outages.
